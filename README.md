# Highlight and Share

Highlight and Share is a React component that enables users to highlight text within an article and instantly share the selected text on Twitter.

When text is highlighted, a share button appears near the selection, providing a convenient way to share content directly from the webpage.

> Please note that the share button is disabled for mobile devices, as they have built-in controls for text selection.
